# Weather Prediction

This paper aims to predict a system that is the “Weather Prediction” system. This paper develops a weather prediction system using the Machine Learning method. For weather prediction here use the weather dataset. This system used some Machine Learning methods like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using Machine Learning methods this system predicts weather like Sun, Rain, Snow, Fog, and Drizzle. That means the system predicts it’s a Sunny day or Rainy day or Snow day or Foggy day or Drizzle day. After applying machine learning methods, the results show that the Random Forest algorithm provides the best accuracy for this system. The proposed system achieved an accuracy that is 94.52%. So Random Forest algorithms are the best for Weather Prediction.
